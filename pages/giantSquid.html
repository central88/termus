      <p>
        The giant squid (Architeuthis dux) is one of the largest invertebrates
        on Earth, known for its elusive nature and immense size. Here are some
        fascinating details about these mysterious creatures:
      </p>

      <ol class="page-ol">
        <li>
          <strong>Size:</strong> Giant squids can grow to impressive lengths of
          up to 43 feet (13 meters) or more. They have long tentacles equipped
          with powerful suction cups, making them formidable predators in the
          deep ocean.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Habitat:</strong> Giant squids inhabit the deep ocean,
          typically found at depths of 1,000 meters or more. They have been
          documented in oceans worldwide, though they are most commonly
          encountered in areas with abundant prey.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diet:</strong> Giant squids primarily feed on fish and other
          cephalopods, including smaller squid. They are known to be active
          hunters, using their tentacles to capture prey with lightning-fast
          strikes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Behavior:</strong> Due to their deep-sea habitat, much of the
          giant squid's behavior remains a mystery. However, they are believed
          to be solitary animals, with limited interactions observed between
          individuals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Anatomy:</strong> Giant squids have large, complex eyes that
          are among the largest in the animal kingdom. These eyes are adapted to
          low-light conditions in the deep ocean and are thought to help them
          locate prey and detect predators.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reproduction:</strong> Despite their large size, relatively
          little is known about the reproductive habits of giant squids. Females
          are thought to lay large egg capsules in deep-sea habitats, where the
          eggs develop before hatching.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encounters:</strong> While giant squids are elusive and rarely
          seen alive, they occasionally wash up on beaches or are captured by
          deep-sea fishermen. These rare encounters provide valuable
          opportunities for scientists to study these mysterious creatures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conservation Status:</strong> Due to their deep-sea habitat
          and elusive nature, the conservation status of giant squids is
          difficult to assess. However, they are not targeted by fisheries and
          are not considered threatened or endangered at this time.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Giant squids continue to captivate the imagination of scientists and the
        public alike, representing one of the many mysteries that lie beneath
        the surface of the ocean.
