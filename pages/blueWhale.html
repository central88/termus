        The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is not only the largest animal on
        Earth currently, but it also holds the title for being the largest
        animal to have ever lived on the planet. Here are some more fascinating
        details about these magnificent creatures:
      </p>

      <ol class="page-ol">
        <li>
          <strong>Size:</strong> Blue whales can grow to impressive lengths of
          up to 100 feet (30 meters) long. To put that into perspective, that's
          about the length of three school buses lined up end to end. They also
          weigh in at around 200 tons or more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diet:</strong> Despite their massive size, blue whales are
          filter feeders, which means they primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like
          animals called krill. They use baleen plates in their mouths to filter
          out the krill from the water as they swim.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Habitat:</strong> Blue whales are found in oceans worldwide,
          though they tend to prefer colder waters for feeding. They migrate
          seasonally, moving towards the poles in the summer to feed and towards
          the equator in the winter to breed and give birth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vocalizations:</strong> Blue whales are known for their deep,
          low-frequency vocalizations, which can travel for thousands of miles
          underwater. These vocalizations are thought to play a role in
          communication, navigation, and possibly even mating.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conservation Status:</strong> Despite their enormous size,
          blue whales are vulnerable to various threats, including ship strikes,
          entanglement in fishing gear, and habitat degradation from pollution
          and climate change. As a result, they are classified as endangered by
          the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reproduction:</strong> Female blue whales typically give birth
          to a single calf every 2-3 years after a gestation period of about
          10-12 months. Calves are born already sizable, measuring around 23
          feet (7 meters) in length and weighing several tons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Longevity:</strong> While the exact lifespan of a blue whale
          isn't definitively known, scientists estimate that they can live for
          around 70 to 90 years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evolutionary History:</strong> Blue whales are part of the
          baleen whale family, which also includes humpback whales and gray
          whales. They evolved from terrestrial mammals that returned to the sea
          millions of years ago.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Blue whales are not only remarkable for their sheer size but also for
        their ecological importance in maintaining the balance of marine
        ecosystems. Protecting these gentle giants is crucial for the health of
        our oceans as a whole.
