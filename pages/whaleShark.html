        The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is the largest fish in the sea and a
        fascinating marine creature. Here are some intriguing details about
        these gentle giants:
      </p>

      <ol class="page-ol">
        <li>
          <strong>Size:</strong> Whale sharks can grow to impressive lengths of
          up to 40 feet (12 meters) or more. Despite their enormous size, they
          are docile creatures, known for their gentle nature and filter-feeding
          behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diet:</strong> As filter feeders, whale sharks primarily
          consume plankton, small fish, and sometimes even small crustaceans.
          They use specialized structures in their mouths called gill rakers to
          filter out their prey from the water as they swim.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Habitat:</strong> Whale sharks are found in tropical and warm
          temperate waters around the world. They inhabit both coastal and
          offshore areas, often frequenting coral reefs, open ocean, and even
          deep waters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Behavior:</strong> Whale sharks are known for their seasonal
          migrations, often following food sources or temperature changes. They
          are solitary animals but may gather in large groups during feeding
          events or when aggregating around certain areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conservation Status:</strong> Despite their large size, whale
          sharks face threats from human activities such as habitat destruction,
          pollution, and bycatch in fishing gear. They are listed as vulnerable
          by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN),
          highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reproduction:</strong> Much about the reproductive behavior of
          whale sharks remains a mystery. Pregnant females have been observed,
          indicating that they give birth to live young, but specific details
          about mating behavior and gestation periods are still being studied.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Longevity:</strong> The exact lifespan of whale sharks is not
          well understood, but scientists estimate that they can live for
          several decades, possibly up to 70 years or more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ecological Importance:</strong> Whale sharks play a crucial
          role in marine ecosystems as apex predators and contributors to
          nutrient cycling. Protecting their habitats and ensuring their
          conservation is essential for the health of ocean ecosystems.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Whale sharks are not only awe-inspiring creatures but also important
        ambassadors for marine conservation. Learning more about these
        magnificent animals can help raise awareness and support efforts to
        safeguard their future.
