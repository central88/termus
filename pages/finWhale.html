      <p>
        The fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) is the second-largest animal on
        Earth, following the blue whale. Here are some fascinating details about
        these majestic creatures:
      </p>

      <ol class="page-ol">
        <li>
          <strong>Size:</strong> Fin whales can grow to impressive lengths of up
          to 85 feet (26 meters) long. While slightly smaller than the blue
          whale, fin whales are still massive in size and can weigh around 80
          tons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diet:</strong> Similar to blue whales, fin whales are filter
          feeders. They primarily consume krill, small fish, and squid, using
          their baleen plates to filter prey from the water as they swim.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Habitat:</strong> Fin whales are found in oceans worldwide,
          inhabiting both deep offshore waters and shallower coastal regions.
          They are known to migrate seasonally, moving to higher latitudes
          during the summer months for feeding and returning to lower latitudes
          in the winter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vocalizations:</strong> Fin whales produce a variety of
          vocalizations, including low-frequency moans and pulses. These sounds
          are thought to be important for communication and potentially for
          navigation and locating prey.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conservation Status:</strong> Like blue whales, fin whales
          face threats such as ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and
          habitat degradation. They are classified as endangered by the
          International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reproduction:</strong> Female fin whales give birth to a
          single calf after a gestation period of about 11 months. Calves are
          born already large, measuring around 20 feet (6 meters) in length and
          weighing several tons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Longevity:</strong> While the exact lifespan of a fin whale is
          not definitively known, scientists estimate that they can live for
          around 70 to 90 years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evolutionary History:</strong> Fin whales belong to the baleen
          whale family, sharing ancestry with blue whales and other large
          whales. They have evolved specialized feeding adaptations to thrive in
          their marine environment.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Fin whales play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, and conservation
        efforts are essential to protect these remarkable animals and their
        habitats.
